## Change Network Adapter connection priority through the Metric value:
Open Control Panel -> Network & Sharing Center -> Change Adapter settings -> RMB Properties -> IPv4 Properties -> Advance 
and uncheck [ ] "Automatic Metric". Write `1` in "Interface Metric". 1 = Primary Network.
Do same for rest network adapters. With higher values than 1.

## Miscellaneous Settings:-

* **IMPORTANT:** It doesn't matter on which drive you install GTA V but you need to install Rockstar Launcher and Social Club in C:\ drive. Steam will download and install then as well as login with your rockstar account for you automatically when you install GTA V from steam. If it doesn't happen then you will have infinite loading time when opening GTA V and Activation problem. Try uninstalling and reinstalling GTA V completely from scratch and clean all the left over from your computer before reinstalling. Do remove all the rockstar softwares etc.

* Check [âœ”] Disable fullscreen optimization for all games. If not disabled, it will make your game run in boderless fullscreen mode which drops fps & increase input lag.
* [VibranceGUI](https://vibrancegui.com/) --> 65%
* Disable Steam Overlay from GTA V Properties in Steam.
